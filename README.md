# Big Data Analytics Final Project

1) This is the html, css and javascript for the index page of our website. The on-click pages are in the folder "data_visualization". To access the website, search https://arvingong96.github.io/2020-Presidential-Election-Democrat-Nominee-Prediction-Analysis/ The website maybe broken for some reason. The map representation does not show in the page for each candidate. To access the website that is properly functioning. Clone this whole repository and lauch the index.html on your local machine preferably with a Chrome.
2) All the codes for the analysis are in the folder called "Backend.zip". Datasets used are in the dataset folder inside the "Backend.zip".
